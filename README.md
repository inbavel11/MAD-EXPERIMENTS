Overview
This project contains multiple experiments focused on different aspects of mobile application development. These experiments include implementations of a secure login system, dynamic font change functionality, a basic calculator, and credential verification methods. Each experiment is designed to be modular, allowing you to integrate them into your projects easily.

Features
1. Login System
Description:
The login system is designed with security in mind. It includes the following features:

Username and Password Validation: Ensures that users enter valid credentials.
Error Handling: Provides feedback for incorrect login attempts.
Session Management: Maintains user sessions securely.
Usage:
Users can log in using their username and password. Upon successful login, they are redirected to the main application screen. If the credentials are incorrect, an error message will be displayed.

2. Font Change Functionality
Description:
This feature allows users to dynamically change the font style and size in the application.

Predefined Font Styles: Includes a selection of popular fonts.
Custom Font Sizes: Users can adjust the font size to their preference.
Real-time Preview: Users can see changes immediately.
Usage:
Navigate to the settings menu and choose the "Font Settings" option. From there, select a font style and size that suits your needs.

3. Calculator
Description:
A simple, yet functional calculator built into the application.

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User-friendly Interface: Designed with ease of use in mind.
Usage:
Access the calculator from the main menu. Enter numbers and select the desired operation to perform calculations.

4. Credential Verification
Description:
Enhances the security of the login system by verifying credentials.

Email Verification: Sends a verification link to the user's email upon registration.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Optional feature for additional security.
Password Strength Checker: Ensures users create strong passwords.
Usage:
Users are required to verify their email address during registration. For enhanced security, 2FA can be enabled from the security settings.
